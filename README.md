# SteamApiProject

This was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis.

This is an API that allows you to access data about all the games (June 2019) on steam. You are able to add/edit/delete games with the following fields.

***(Need node to be installed)

Set up:

```yarn add ```
(Add the dependencies)

```node index.js``` (Get the server running)


Access the main page through the index html page. 

Using the API is quite easy, click the button the left to a random game's info.

Add a game to the database by putting in the info and then click submit to see your games' info!

The edit/delete are not working correctly currently!
