# SteamApiProject

This was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis.

Access the main page through the index html page. 

Using the API is quite easy, click the button the left to a random game's info.

Add a game to the database by putting in the info and then click submit to see your games' info!


The edit/delete are not working correctly currently!
